# Project 1: Predicting House Prices

**Objective**: Build a model to predict house prices based on various features.

**Description**: Use a dataset containing information about houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location) to create a predictive model that estimates the price of a house.

**Key Steps**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression)
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning

**Contents**:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset for house prices.
- `code/`: Contains the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
