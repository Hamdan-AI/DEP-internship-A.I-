## [Project 3: Predicting Customer Churn](Project3/README.md)

**Objective**: Develop a model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their usage patterns and demographics.

**Description**: Use a dataset containing customer information and usage data to train a model that can predict the likelihood of customer churn.

**Key Steps**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., logistic regression, random forests)
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning
- Implementing the model in a real-world system
