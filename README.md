# DEP Internship Projects

This repository contains multiple projects completed as part of the Digital Empowerment Pakistan (DEP) internship program. Each project focuses on a different aspect of machine learning and data analysis.

## Project 1: Predicting House Prices

**Objective**: Build a model to predict house prices based on various features.

**Description**: Use a dataset containing information about houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location) to create a predictive model that estimates the price of a house.

**Key Steps**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression)
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning

## Project 2: Classifying Emails as Spam or Not Spam

**Objective**: Create a model to classify emails as spam or not spam.

**Description**: Use a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam to train a classifier that can automatically detect spam emails.

**Key Steps**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., text preprocessing, tokenization)
- Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF)
- Model selection and training (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning

## Project 3: Predicting Customer Churn

**Objective**: Develop a model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their usage patterns and demographics.

**Description**: Use a dataset containing customer information and usage data to train a model that can predict the likelihood of customer churn.

**Key Steps**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., logistic regression, random forests)
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning
- Implementing the model in a real-world system

## Project 4: Image Classification

**Objective**: Build a model to classify images into different categories.

**Description**: Use a labeled dataset of images (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST) to train a deep learning model that can classify images into predefined categories.

**Key Steps**:
- Data augmentation and preprocessing (e.g., normalization, resizing)
- Building a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Training the model with a training dataset
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning using a validation dataset
- Handling overfitting with techniques like dropout and regularization
